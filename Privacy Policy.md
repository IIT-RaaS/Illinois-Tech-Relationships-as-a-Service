### What measures do we take to ensure data remains private?
All the data mentioned above is stored only on the Google Drive account of the developer maintaining this service and is not shared with anyone under any circumstances aside from the exceptions specified in this privacy policy. Google encrypts all data-at-rest and data-in-transit, including the information collected. For more information, see https://cloud.google.com/security/encryption/default-encryption.

### Which third parties have access to the information?
1. no one except the two additional parties specified below
2. no one except the two additional parties specified below
3. all potential match candidates, defined as users who match in preferred gender (their gender is your preferred gender and vice versa) and desired types of relationships (friendships without benefits, hookups, relationships without sex, and relationships with sex)
4. all matches, defined as potential match candidates who have mutually "liked" each other for the same types of relationships
5. no one except the two additional parties specified below - however, match criteria, defined as the types of relationships for which potential match candidates mutually "liked" each other, will be shared with the respective match

Two additional parties have access to all of the above information (1-5):

### What rights do consumers have for viewing, modifying, and safeguarding their personal data?
Consumers can request a copy of their personal data (1-4) for viewing and modification by reaching out to us on Instagram @iit.relationships or by emailing us at iitrelationships@gmail.com. They will have to send proof of identity in order to view or modify this information. Such proof can be in the form of one of the following:
* taking personal photos (selfies) in uncommon positions dictated by us
* reaching out via the email or Instagram account associated with that user during sign-up

As of version 3.0, any information entered during sign-up can be modified by reaching out to us on Instagram @iit.relationships or via email at iitrelationships@gmail.com. However, consumers who modify their sign-up information will NOT be able to view or resubmit their likes/dislikes for potential candidates whose corresponding likes/dislikes have already been processed (matched or rejected). The implications of this are illustrated in the following example.
Given the following conditions:
1. user A originally requested only relationship type Friendship without Benefits, while user B requested all relationship types
2. both users A and B submitted their likes/dislikes for each other and either matched or were rejected
3. user A requests to add relationship type Relationships without Sex

Under these conditions, user A will no longer be able to view or submit likes/dislikes for user B despite having added a potential relationship type because the match or lack thereof has already been processed.

Additionally, any match emails already sent out to matches cannot be modified due to the limitations of email. Therefore, consumers are encouraged to take extra care in providing us with correct information for 4 (discord tag).

As mentioned above, consumers will receive a form via personal email for submitting their likes/dislikes (5) for other potential match candidates. They can request a copy of their selected likes/dislikes, but due to our scripts immediately handling this information, we cannot guarantee modification (no undo). Therefore, consumers are encouraged to take extra care in correctly entering their likes/dislikes on their provided matching form, and this matching form is not to be shared with anyone. However, likes and dislikes CAN be resubmitted given that they have not yet been processed. This occurs when the potential relationship candidate in question has not yet submitted their corresponding likes/dislikes. The implications of this are illustrated in the following example.
Given the following conditions:
1. users A and B are potential candidates
2. user A submits likes/dislikes for user B but user B has not yet submitted likes/dislikes for user A

Under these conditions, user A will be able to modify likes/dislikes for user B because the previously-submitted likes/dislikes have not yet been processed. Changes to likes/dislikes can likewise be requested by reaching out to us on Instagram @iit.relationships or via email at iitrelationships@gmail.com.

Feel free to reach out to us on Instagram @iit.relationships or email us at iitrelationships@gmail.com with any questions or for clarification.
